Hi Guys, Im Ganishwar Arun . i did this shopping-cart using React_JS to build the UI and function for components and  Tailwind CSS to style the components .

I implementing this cart functionality in React JS.  I used React Hooks to manage the state of the cart. 
I used the Context API to pass the cart state to the components that need it. 
I used the Local Storage API to persist the cart state in the browser i.e the Dummy Json to get the products that we will be displaying in our application. 
importantly i used the react concept like useState, useContext, useEffect, toogle function

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->
